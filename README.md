# HelmHub.io Containers

Community-maintained container images, forked from Bitnami to continue open-source development.

## About

After Bitnami's transition away from open source, we created HelmHub.io to maintain and develop container images for the community.

## Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - We're actively migrating and updating container definitions.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! This is a community effort to keep quality container images available.

## License

Maintaining the original open-source licensing where applicable.
